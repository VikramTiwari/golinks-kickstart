## Add yours?

Do you have ideas about a new go/links category or want to add your website to an existing route? Feel free to create a new PR! Please add new routes and links alphabetically so that it's easier for humans to read and modify. Machines will self-optimize!

### Sponsor

You sponsorships help keep the project active and improvements ongoing. It takes less than the cost of a coffee to sponsor the project! Consider sponsoring the project if it saves you time and helps you in your daily tasks.
